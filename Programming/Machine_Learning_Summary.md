# ML Classification.
### 1. Target Variable.
- Supervised Learning: o.
- Unsupervised Learning: x.
- Semi-supervised Learning: only few samples.
- Reinforcement Learning: given after prediction.
### 2. Real-time Training Dataset.
- Online Learning: real-time streaming.
- Offline Learning: collected in advance.
### 3. Training Models or Not.
- Model-based Learning: train and build a generalized model.
- Instance-based Learning: keep and compare with instances.
