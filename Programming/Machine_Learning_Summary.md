# ML Classification.
### 1. Target Variable.
- Supervised Learning: o.
- Unsupervised Learning: x.
- Semi-supervised Learning: only few samples.
- Reinforcement Learning: given after prediction.
### 2. Real-time Training dataset.
- Online learning: real-time streaming.
- Offline learning: collected in advance.
### 3. Training models or not.
- Model-based learning: train and build a generalized model.
- Instance-based learning: keep and compare with instances.
