# Ways of Classifying ML Models.
### 1. Whether target variable is in trainging set.
- Supervised learning: o.
- Unsupervised learning: x.
- Semi-supervised learning: partially o.
- Reinforcement learning: trianing with small samples without target variable -> target variable given later -> compare and improve algorithm with this
  -> perform this process repetitively.
### 2. Whether training is in real time.
- Online learning: o (by model itself).
- Offline learning (Batch learning): x (by a person).
### 3. Whether training makes a rule.
- Model-based learning: o (model induced from datas).
- Instance-based learning: x (just search the most similar one among many datas).
